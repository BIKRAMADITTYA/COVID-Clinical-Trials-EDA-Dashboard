# COVID-19 Clinical Trials: EDA & Power BI Dashboard

---

## **Project Overview**

This project provides an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of global **COVID-19 clinical trials** data, complemented by an **interactive Power BI dashboard**. The primary goal is to uncover key trends, patterns, and insights related to trial statuses, phases, start dates, age demographics, and intervention types.

---

## **Key Features & Analysis**

* **Comprehensive Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, converted data types, and addressed duplicates to ensure data quality.
* **Temporal Analysis of Trial Starts:** Visualized the evolution of trial initiations over time, highlighting periods of high research activity during the pandemic.
* **Trial Status Distribution:** Explored the breakdown of trials by their current status (e.g., completed, recruiting, terminated), providing an overview of the research landscape.
* **Clinical Phase Breakdown:** Analyzed the distribution of trials across different clinical phases (e.g., Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3), showing the progression of research.
* **Age Group Demographics:** Investigated the most common age groups targeted in these trials.
* **Relationship Analysis:** Examined the interplay between trial statuses and phases, and explored common outcome measures associated with various conditions.
* **Interactive Power BI Dashboard:** A dynamic dashboard built to allow users to interactively explore the cleaned data, filter by various parameters, and drill down into specific insights.

## **Tools & Technologies**

* **Python:**
    * `pandas`: For robust data manipulation and analysis.
    * `matplotlib.pyplot`: For static data visualizations.
    * `seaborn`: For enhanced statistical data visualizations.
* **Power BI:** For creating a comprehensive, interactive, and shareable data dashboard.
