# COVID-19 Clinical Trials: EDA & Power BI Dashboard

---

## **Project Overview**

This project provides an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of global **COVID-19 clinical trials** data, complemented by an **interactive Power BI dashboard**. The primary goal is to uncover key trends, patterns, and insights related to trial statuses, phases, start dates, age demographics, and intervention types.

## **Key Features & Analysis**

* **Comprehensive Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, converted data types, and addressed duplicates to ensure data quality.
* **Temporal Analysis of Trial Starts:** Visualized the evolution of trial initiations over time, highlighting periods of high research activity during the pandemic.
* **Trial Status Distribution:** Explored the breakdown of trials by their current status (e.g., completed, recruiting, terminated), providing an overview of the research landscape.
* **Clinical Phase Breakdown:** Analyzed the distribution of trials across different clinical phases (e.g., Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3), showing the progression of research.
* **Age Group Demographics:** Investigated the most common age groups targeted in these trials.
* **Relationship Analysis:** Examined the interplay between trial statuses and phases, and explored common outcome measures associated with various conditions.
* **Interactive Power BI Dashboard:** A dynamic dashboard built to allow users to interactively explore the cleaned data, filter by various parameters, and drill down into specific insights.

## **Tools & Technologies**

* **Python:**
    * `pandas`: For robust data manipulation and analysis.
    * `matplotlib.pyplot`: For static data visualizations.
    * `seaborn`: For enhanced statistical data visualizations.
* **Power BI:** For creating a comprehensive, interactive, and shareable data dashboard.

## **Data Source**

The dataset used for this analysis is `COVID clinical trials.csv`, containing information on clinical trials related to COVID-19.
* `[Link to dataset source, if publicly available. If not, you can state: "A publicly available dataset on COVID-19 clinical trials."]`

## **Power BI Dashboard**

Explore the data interactively through the Power BI dashboard:

* **View Dashboard Online:** `[Insert link to your published Power BI dashboard here, if you've published it to Power BI Service. If not, you can remove this line.]`
* **Dashboard File:** The Power BI dashboard file (`.pbix`) is included in the `power_bi_dashboard/` folder for local viewing.

**Key Dashboard Pages/Insights:**
* `[Briefly describe 1-2 key sections or types of insights users can find in your dashboard, e.g., "Overview of global trial status distribution," "Trends of trials by intervention type over time," "Breakdown of interventions by study condition."]`
